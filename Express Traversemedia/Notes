What is Express?
----------------
Express is a fast, unopinionated and minimalist web framework for Node.js.

Express is a "server-side" or "back-end" framework. It is not comparable to client-side frameworks like React, Angular & Vue. It can be used in combination with those frameworks to build full stack applications.


Why use Express?
----------------
-makes building web applications with Node.js much easier 
-Used for both server rendered apps as well as API/Microservices
-Extremely light, fast and freee
-Full control of request and response
-By far the most popular Node framework
-Great to use with client side frameworks because it's js

Middleware
----------
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response object. Express has built in middleware but middleware also comes from 3rd party packages as well as custom middleware.
- Execute any code
- Make changes to the request/response object
- End response cycle
- Call next middleware in the stack
